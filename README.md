```

## Runtime

Try the program by running the command below, with an optional integer argument between 0 and 2:

```


## Known issues

SDL2 v2.0.10 causes a drawing bug: rendering something changes the color of a specific pixel of the last drawn object. This bug however is not present in versions 2.0.8 and 2.0.14. Should it arise, uninstall the libsdl2-dev package, then install [this one](https://packages.debian.org/sid/libsdl2-2.0-0) and [this one.](https://packages.debian.org/source/sid/libsdl2) Finally, libsdl2-image-dev and libsdl2-ttf-dev may need to be updated after that.
